				paragraph:
					'At its height, QRPG had over 13,000 followers on the Steam Workshop. The functionalities and combined utilities of QRPG were very sought after, but there were glaring issues with the netcode and rendering engine of Tabletop Simulator. Pair this last fact with the ever-flowing and inevitable breaking changes to the Tabletop Simulator Lua API and we have a huge maintenence cost. After distributing QRPG the dev team, mostly because of the aforementioned struggles, wanted to move on. Since then I have only worked on critical bugfixes and documentation enhancements. Working with the unstable engine and legacy scripting code base is too laborious to implement and maintain new features.',

					'In the fall of 2018 the organization I was working for wanted to move massive amounts of content from one CMS to another. They had no technical solution for this and planned to test it all using a force of QAs. This was unacceptable to me so I took it upon myself to prototype this tool that would collect and analyze the data across our different CMS. The prototype was a success and I continued to develop My Little Charlotte until it reached production quality and was feature complete.',
