TODO find a way to declare the height of a building as the end of the canvas, rather than a random huge percentage
TODO decide if how non-mobile views would be rendered (completely new drawing set, modification on a base, etc)
REVIEW does the observer position need to change in the math mapping? The vanishing point should always stay on the same part of the screen. Should the height of the distant objects really decrease?
