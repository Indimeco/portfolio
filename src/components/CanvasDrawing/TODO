TODO make canvas only render what's currently on screen to preserve performance
TODO make more city-like high perspective view, not in rows
TODO make heading animate in on a car/block/sign instead of float
REVIEW why does higher observer distance = closer? bug
TODO add detail to buildings
TODO sky design


Decisions
* mobile views will just be a subset of the wider canvas rather than squishing/stretching the drawing or rendering different drawings for different views
* builds view wil lnot have infinite height. It will have a natural height and end as a 3d object would
* sectioned views work via a system of landmarks. Landmarks can be used to designate the start or end of a type of drawing e.g., where the street level should end. This allows me to create a semi structured flow of visuals while remaining mostly flexible based on the canvas size.

Current outline:
<Heading /> // High city view
<About /> // Building view
<Portfolio title={sections.titles[1]} /> // street view
<Contact title={sections.titles[2]} /> // undercity view
