TODO subdivide canvas into sections and make the whole background one canvas
TODO make drawing data not use percentages of canvas width/height/depth. Drawing data should resolve its own dimensions and overflow would be cut off the screen (not seen on smaller devices)
TODO make canvas only render what's currently on screen to preserve performance
TODO make more city-like high perspective view, not in rows
REVIEW why does higher observer distance = closer? bug
TODO add detail to buildings
TODO street view
TODO undercity view
TODO sky design


Decisions
* mobile views will just be a subset of the wider canvas rather than squishing/stretching the drawing or rendering different drawings for different views
* builds view wil lnot have infinite height. It will have a natural height and end as a 3d object would

Current outline:
<Heading /> // High city view
<About /> // Building view
<Portfolio title={sections.titles[1]} /> // street view
<Contact title={sections.titles[2]} /> // undercity view
